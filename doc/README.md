Tessera
=============

Setup
---------------------
Tessera is a post-quantum UTXO cryptocurrency: it signs with ML-DSA-44 (FIPS 204)
instead of an elliptic curve, hashes with SHA3-256, and secures its chain with the
SHA3-256d proof of work. The node downloads and, by default, stores the entire
history of Tessera transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and
network connection, the synchronization process can take some time.

To build Tessera from source, see the build notes below.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Tessera on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/tessera-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/tesserad` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run `tessera-qt.exe`.
