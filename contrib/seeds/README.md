# Seeds

Utility to generate the seeds.txt list that is compiled into the client
(see [src/chainparamsseeds.h](/src/chainparamsseeds.h) and other utilities in [contrib/seeds](/contrib/seeds)).

Be sure to update `PATTERN_AGENT` in `makeseeds.py` to include the current version,
and remove old versions as necessary (at a minimum when SeedsServiceFlags()
changes its default return value, as those are the services which seeds are added
to addrman with).

Update `MIN_BLOCKS` in  `makeseeds.py` and the `-m`/`--minblocks` arguments below, as needed.

The seeds compiled into a release are created from a DNS seed / crawler dump and
asmap community AS map data. Tessera has no public DNS seeders yet, so the
`nodes_*.txt` files are empty placeholders until the network has reliable nodes.
Once a seeder is available, run the following commands from the `/contrib/seeds`
directory (replacing `<tessera-dns-seed>` with the actual seeder host):

```
curl https://<tessera-dns-seed>/seeds.txt.gz | gzip -dc > seeds_main.txt
curl https://<tessera-dns-seed>/seeds_test.txt.gz | gzip -dc > seeds_test.txt
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asmap/asmap-data/main/latest_asmap.dat > asmap-filled.dat
python3 makeseeds.py -a asmap-filled.dat -s seeds_main.txt > nodes_main.txt
python3 makeseeds.py -a asmap-filled.dat -s seeds_test.txt > nodes_test.txt
python3 generate-seeds.py . > ../../src/chainparamsseeds.h
```
