    //! generate automatically generate new descriptors if it is later
    //! encrypted. To support this behavior, descriptor wallets unlike legacy
    //! wallets do not automatically unset the BLANK flag when things are
    //! imported.
    //!
    //! This flag is also a mandatory flag to prevent previous versions of
    //! bitcoin from opening the wallet, thinking it was newly created, and

// for (no xpub homomorphism). Tessera's wallet uses a direct ML-DSA HD keystore
// rather than a DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan.
