// Tessera block-size economics: ML-DSA-44 signatures are ~35x larger than
// ECDSA (sig 2420 + pubkey 1312 vs ~72 + 33 bytes), so a Bitcoin-sized block
// would hold ~1/30th the payments. A 32 MB block restores Bitcoin-like payment
// throughput (~8.5-9k tx/block). Tessera gives no witness discount, so the
// weight model is simply vsize = serialized bytes (WITNESS_SCALE_FACTOR = 1)
// and MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT == MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE.
